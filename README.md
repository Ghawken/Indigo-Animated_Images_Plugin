## Animated Images Control Page Plugin

Another fairly straight forward Plugin.

Spins up another built in Sanic app to manage animated gif's and webm images in Control pages/and in Indigo Touch.


Basically it adds animated images either Gifs or Webm to Pictures/Indigo-AnimatedImages, correct folder will be created on plugin startup.

Then Add URL to images via

http://127.0.0.1:8405/homer.gif

to Any control page as a refreshing URL.  This will be animated at the time frequency you set in the control page settings.
